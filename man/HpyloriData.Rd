\title{
    H. pylori data
}
\description{ 
    SNP positions and allele frequencies for the reference data
}
\details{
    A \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GPos}} class object containing
    the vertex and reference population 
    allele frequencies for the
    set of 143733 SNPs used in the analysis for H. pylori.
    The SNPs were created using HpGP-26695-ATCC as the 
    reference genome.
    The set of SNPs was selected using a MAF threshold of 0.01.
    The total sample size was from a set of 1011 H. pylori strains.
